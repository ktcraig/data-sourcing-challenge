# data-sourcing-challenge
Module 6 challenge

My homework is stored in file "New_retrieve_data.ipynb". Git hub said that it was unable to render code block in my repo as a preview so I also added a copy in case the grader also experiences this. When I download from github the code is all present and correct.

Source Code References:

Tutoring Help from TA Luna 11/24: - Assisted in: Merging dataframe, .info simplification, indexing and changing columns to strings using pd.Series

Note - There is an error in the starter code. On the GST data it asked for ActivityID again which is not a column in GST api. ActivityID is stored in the LinkedIn Events Dictionary in GST Data. Appears that starter code should have listed "gstID" as the column instead of activityID. Confirmed with Tutor this is an error in the starter code and used "gstID" as it is referenced later in starter code

Xpert Assistant feedback: - Assisted in:  Utilizing .isnull instead of dropna for subset of linkedEvents, error handling for datetim
